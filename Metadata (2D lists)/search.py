# FOR ALL OF THESE FUNCTIONS, READ THE FULL INSTRUCTIONS.

# 1) 
#
# Function: search
#
# Parameters:
#   keyword - search word to look for in article metadata's relevant keywords
#
# Returns: list of metadata for articles in which the article is relevant to
#   the keyword. Relevance is determined by checking the metadata's "relevant
#   keywords" list for a case-insensitive match with the keyword parameter. #   The returned list should not include the "relevant keywords" list for each
#   article metadata.
#   
#   If the user does not enter anything, return an empty list
#
# Hint: to get list of existing article metadata, use article_metadata()

    return result

# 2) 
#
# Function: article_length
#
# Parameters:
#   max_length - max character length of articles
#   metadata - article metadata to search through
#
# Returns: list of article metadata from given metadata with articles not
#   exceeding max_length number of characters

# 3) 
#
# Function: unique_authors
#
# Parameters:
#   count - max number of unique authors to include in the results
#   metadata - article metadata
#
# Returns: list of article metadata containing a maximum of `count` results,
#   each with a unique author. If two or more articles have the same author, 
#   include the first in the results and skip the others. Two authors are 
#   considered the same if they are a case-insensitive match. If count is 
#   larger than the number of unique authors, return all articles with the 
#   duplicate authors removed.

# 4) 
#
# Function: most_recent_article
#
# Parameters:
#   metadata - article metadata
#
# Returns: article metadata of the article published most recently according
#   to the timestamp. Note this should return just a 1D list representing
#   a single article.

# 5) 
#
# Function: favorite_author
#
# Parameters:
#   favorite - favorite author title
#   metadata - article metadata
#
# Returns: True if favorite author is in the given articles (case 
#   insensitive), False otherwise

# 6)

# Function: title_and_author

# Parameters:
#   metadata - article metadata
#
# Returns: list of Tuples containing (title, author) for all of the given 
#   metadata.

# 7) 
#
# Function: refine_search
#
# Parameters:
#   keyword - additional keyword to search
#   metadata - article metadata from basic search
#
# Returns: searches for article metadata from entire list of available
#   articles using keyword. Returns the article metadata that is returned in 
#   in *both* the additional search and the basic search. The results should
#   be in the same order that they were returned in the basic search. Two
#   articles can be considered the same if both their author and article title
#   match exactly.
